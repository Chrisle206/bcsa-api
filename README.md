# BCS Adventuers (API)

## Description

This is the API for the final project of our coding bootcamp, built using MongoDB and Mongoose and deployed on Heroku. It hosts all user, character and enemy data, and provides that data as it's requested from the front end, which is hosted in a separate repository linked below. I developed the API alone while the rest of my team devoted their efforts to building the front end, understanding that the front was where most of the time was going to have to go. I faced several challenges constructing this API because it was my first time using MongoDB and Mongoose, having previously only worked with Sequelize. Mongo was easier to set up and more intuitive, but learning any new tech comes with its hardships. In the end, I was able to finish with plenty of time to help develop the front end more. The experience I've gained from working on the back-end for two class projects in a row has been invaluable to me, as I find I quite enjoy it. It has also brought to my awareness, however, that I must touch-up on my skills with the front-end. All-in-all, the API does what it's supposed to, and it was a joy to develop.

## Usage

There are a handful of routes that the API and front-end operate on. There are POST routes for signing up, logging in, and creating characters, GET requests for retrieving character and enemy data, and PUT requests for updating the character's stats and wealth upon defeating an enemy. Please refer to the 'routes' folder in the repository to access these routes directly and see how to use them.
